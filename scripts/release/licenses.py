- the package's files that name others (REUSE: by their SPDX lines, or REUSE.toml), with their
  copyright lines and their licenses' texts from LICENSES/: the modules ported from Manim CE;
- the crates compiled into the engine, in every build of it a wheel holds, with the license and
  notice files each ships: the workspace's crates, those of the sources they fetch (x264's,
  FFmpeg's and libopus's, mitex's); a crate from crates.io that ships none, its license's text
  from LICENSES/, with its authors on the line the text keeps for them.

And check that manimgx's `license` (pyproject.toml) covers all of it: that each
part's license is satisfied by the licenses it names. The Linux wheels' lavapipe has a notice of
its own, LICENSE-LAVAPIPE.

`python scripts/release/licenses.py` (`just licenses`) writes it; `--check` fails if it is stale or
something is not covered (tests/test_licenses.py).
