    Scene time is exact: a rational number of seconds, never rounded. A play or wait of
    `d` seconds that begins at time `T` owns the frames whose times fall in
    `[T, T + d)`, each showing the world at its own instant, frame `k` at exactly
    `k / fps`; then the world is brought to `T + d` itself, where `construct` goes on
    and the next frame finds it. When `construct` returns, a closing frame shows the

                and the animations it played, the world as the play left it.
            take: Record the film as a take instead, for manimgx's player to draw: a
                function handed its bytes as they are recorded (a
                [`Take`][manimgx.rendering.film.Take]). A take has no video, and no frames for

    r"""A scene seen in three dimensions: from a camera that orbits it, with perspective
    and depth.

    The camera looks at the center of its frame from the angles `phi`, from the z axis
    (0 looks straight down on the xy plane), and `theta`, around it (−90° by default, so
    that x points right); `gamma` turns it about its line of sight, `zoom` magnifies,
    and `focal_distance` is how far it is from the point it looks at. Each is a
    [value tracker][manimgx.ValueTracker] of the [camera][manimgx.Camera], so it moves
    as any mobject does: [`move_camera`][manimgx.ThreeDScene.move_camera] animates it,
    and an ambient rotation keeps it turning. Nearer surfaces hide farther ones;
    mobjects fixed in the frame are drawn flat on the screen, over everything.
