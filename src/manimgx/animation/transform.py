    The mobject stays in the scene and ends looking like `target_mobject`, which is not
    added (with [`ReplacementTransform`][manimgx.ReplacementTransform], the target takes
    the mobject's place). Their parts are matched up one to one (the side with fewer
    parts gains some, and so do the points of each pair), so the mobject may end with
    more parts than it had. Each point travels from its start to its end in a straight
    line, or along an arc with `path_arc`.

    Transforms that begin together on one mobject compose: `square.animate.shift(RIGHT)`
    and `Rotate(square)` played together move the square and turn it. One that begins
    later takes the mobject over from where the others have brought it. A target that
    has updaters and is not in the scene moves while the animation plays (the animation
    runs its updaters), and the mobject follows it.

    Args:
        mobject: The mobject to transform.
        target_mobject: The mobject it turns into; None creates an empty target when
            `keys` is omitted. Passing only `keys` leaves `target_mobject` as None.
        path_func: How each point travels from its start to its end: a function of the
            start points, the end points and the progress (see
            [paths][manimgx.Path]); it replaces `path_arc` and `path_arc_centers`.
            None: a straight path.
        path_arc: The angle each point turns through on its way, in radians: 0 is a
            straight path, and a positive angle turns counterclockwise.
        path_arc_axis: The axis the arcs of `path_arc` turn about.
        path_arc_centers: A point the mobject turns about by `path_arc` on its way, or
            one for each of its points; None: each point turns about the center of its
            own arc.
        replace_mobject_with_target_in_scene: Whether an independent target takes
            the mobject's place when the animation finishes. Presets without
            such a target retain their usual removal or restoration behavior.
        keys: Two or more states to pass through, in order: None for the mobject as the
            animation starts, a function of it, or a mobject, copied when the animation
            starts. Without them, the states are the mobject and `target_mobject`.

class Animate[M: Mobject](Transform[M], _Methods):
    """An animation of a mobject's method calls.

    It is what [`mobject.animate`][manimgx.Mobject.animate] returns. Call methods on it
    as on the mobject, `square.animate.shift(RIGHT).scale(2)`, and play it: it is the
    animation. Each call is recorded and tried at once on a copy, so a wrong call fails
    where it is written, and the calls are carried out on the mobject as it is when the
    animation begins (in a [`Succession`][manimgx.Succession], after the parts before
    it). When it finishes, the mobject is exactly what the calls make of it.

    The mobject moves as the calls do: a turn among them (`rotate`, `flip`) turns it
    rigidly, through its whole angle (`rotate(TAU)` is a full turn), about its pivot as
    the motion carries it; any other call moves its
    center in a straight line; and the rest of the change (a scale, a color, a new
    shape) happens along the way. A `path_arc` or `path_func` of its own replaces that
    motion.

    Called before any method, it takes the animation's
    [options][manimgx.animation.transform.TransformOptions]:
    `square.animate(run_time=2, rate_func=linear).shift(RIGHT)`. It also takes an edit,
    a function applied to the mobject as a method would be:
    `square.animate(lambda mob: mob.shift(RIGHT))`.

    Args:
        mobject: The mobject whose method calls are animated.

    Examples:
        ```python
        import manimgx as m


        class AnimateExample(m.Scene):
            def construct(self) -> None:
