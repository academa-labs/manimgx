    An animation plays for `run_time` seconds of the scene's time. Its progress,
    `alpha`, goes from 0 at its start to 1 at its end, eased by its rate function (by
    default [`smooth`][manimgx.smooth]: slow, fast, slow). The parts of its mobject (the
    members of its family that have points) can be staggered: with a `lag_ratio`, each
    part begins that fraction of its run after the part before it, so 0 moves them all
    together and 1 one after another.

    [`Scene.play`][manimgx.Scene.play] plays it: `begin` when it starts, which takes the
    mobject as it is then; `interpolate(alpha)` at every frame; `finish` at its end;
    then `clean_up_from_scene`. An introducer brings its mobject into the scene when it
    begins, any other animation when the play begins (if the scene lacks it), and a
    remover takes its mobject out when it finishes. The
    mobject's own updaters keep running while it plays: each frame shows the animation
    applied to the mobject as its updaters have it then, and when the animation finishes
    the mobject is as its last frame showed it.

    To write your own, subclass it and override one hook. `interpolate_submobject` sets
    one part of the mobject at its own progress, already eased and staggered, from that
    part as it was when the animation began. `interpolate_mobject` sets the whole
    mobject at the animation's progress, which it gets before easing: apply
    `self.rate_func(alpha)` yourself. Override `begin` to set things up when the
    animation starts (and call the base's). The options are attributes of the same names
    (`self.rate_func`, `self.lag_ratio`, …), and a class changes their defaults in
    `defaults`. An `Animation` itself changes nothing: it holds its mobject in the scene
    for its run time.

    Whole-mobject presets that use only current state declare no keyframes. A subclass
    needing its starting state can set `keys = (None,)` and read `frames[0]` after
    `begin`.

    Args:
        mobject: The mobject to animate; None for none, as a [`Wait`][manimgx.Wait] has.
