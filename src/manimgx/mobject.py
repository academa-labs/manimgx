    A time-based updater is handed `dt`, the seconds since it last ran. Most compose:
    one that moves the mobject at a rate (`mob.shift(dt * velocity)`), or sets it by a
    function of the time it has run, does the same in one step of `dt` as in two of
    `dt / 2`. A flow runs at every instant the scene computes — each frame, and the end
    of each play and wait — handed exactly the time since, so every frame shows it at
    that frame's instant.

    Any other time-based updater is simulated, since what it does may depend on its
    steps (an integrator, a ball that bounces): it steps on a clock of its own,
    `config.simulation_rate` ticks a second (60) and the end of each play and wait, so
    it takes the same steps at any frame rate, and a frame shows it as its last tick
    left it. While one is in the scene, the scene computes every tick, between frames
    too. Declare an updater that composes a flow to make it exact at every frame and to
    spare those ticks; [always_shift][manimgx.always_shift] and
    [always_rotate][manimgx.always_rotate] add flows. An updater that only reads the

        finishes, the calls are carried out on the mobject itself.

        The motion follows the calls: a turn among them (`rotate`, `flip`) turns the
        mobject rigidly about its pivot, through its whole angle (`rotate(TAU)` is a full turn); every other call moves its center

        a call. Call a method of your own class so: through `animate`, a type checker
