class ImageMobject(MeshMobject):
    """A picture: an image file or an array of pixels, on a rectangle as tall as its
    pixels make it.

    An image `scale_to_resolution` pixels tall (1080 unless given) is as tall as the
    frame's short side (8 scene units by default), and any other in proportion. Shown
    larger than its pixels, the picture is reconstructed from them by
    `resampling_algorithm`: by default a smooth cubic through every pixel; linear blends
    neighboring pixels; nearest shows each pixel as a square of its color. Shown smaller,
    it is sampled, not averaged. The mobject's opacity multiplies its pixels' own.

    Args:
        filename_or_array: The picture: an image file's path, the file's contents
            (bytes), or an array of pixel values from 0 to 255: (h, w) gray, (h, w, 3)
            RGB or (h, w, 4) RGBA.
        scale_to_resolution: How many pixels tall an image as tall as the frame's
            short side is; 0 for an image 3 units tall, whatever its size.
        invert: Whether its colors are inverted (not its transparency).
        image_mode: The mode, as the Pillow library names them, a file is read in:
            "RGBA", or "L" for gray.
        resampling_algorithm: How the picture is reconstructed from its pixels, by the
            Pillow library's number: 0, nearest; 2, linear; 3, cubic (Keys' cubic
            convolution, Pillow's bicubic);
            [RESAMPLING_ALGORITHMS][manimgx.RESAMPLING_ALGORITHMS] gives them by name.
        stroke_width: The width of a border around the picture, in hundredths of a
            scene unit; 0 for none.
        stroke_color: The border's color.
