"""Typeset mobjects from Typst, literal Unicode, and LaTeX source.

Typst documents as mobjects: every glyph and shape of the layout becomes a part (a glyph its
outline, shared per font and glyph, placed where Typst put it). After CE 0.21 (MIT).

CE's Pango text classes, typeset by Typst: one submobject per non-space glyph, in reading
order, sized so a font-size-48 capital has CE's height.

The text is set literally, as Typst strings. Slant and weight (`t2s`, `t2w`) change the layout,
so they are set as runs; color does not: every glyph knows the characters it draws,
so `gradient`, `t2g` and `t2c` color it by character, and a glyph whose characters differ in
color is cut at its carets. A key is a slice "[a:b]" or each occurrence of a string; a key that
occurs nowhere picks nothing.

CE's LaTeX classes, typeset by Typst: LaTeX converted by mitex, so `MathTex("a", "=", "b")[i]`
is part i. A MathTex's parts are one formula; Tex's are set one after another, each labelled.

class Typst(VMobject):
    r"""A Typst document, typeset in the engine: every glyph and shape of its layout is
    a part, white unless styled.

    The code is Typst markup, a document's body on a page as large as what it holds:
    `*strong*`, `_emphasis_`, math between `$` signs, `#set` and `#show` rules, and the
    rest of Typst. The parts are what Typst lays out, in document order, spaces
    excluded: glyphs ([TypstGlyph][manimgx.mobjects.text.TypstGlyph]) and
    shapes (a rule, a fraction's bar, a box). A labelled box, `#box[…] <name>`, is a
    group: [select][manimgx.Typst.select] gives it. Packages are imported from
    `package_path` (and mitex, `@preview/mitex:0.2.7`, from manimgx's engine), never
    downloaded; code Typst can't typeset raises a
    [TypstError][manimgx.drawing.typesetting.TypstError].

    Text is set in Libertinus Serif and math in New Computer Modern Math, Typst's
    defaults, unless the code sets another font. The fonts are those manimgx ships, so a
    document looks the same on every machine: Typst's own (these two, New Computer
    Modern and DejaVu Sans Mono), Noto Sans, and Noto faces for the scripts those lack,
    from Arabic, Hebrew and Devanagari to Chinese, Japanese and Korean, with symbols and
    emoji; a character a font lacks is set in one that has it. Fonts in `font_paths`
    come first, and a system font is read only for a family the code names that none of
    these has. A paragraph's direction and the forms of Han characters follow the code's
    `lang` and `dir` (`#set text(lang: "ja")`, `#set text(dir: rtl)`); a
    [Text][manimgx.Text] sets them from its characters.

    What Typst paints in its default ink, black, takes `color`, and the colors the code
    sets are kept, unless paint keywords (`fill_color` and the rest) paint over every
    part. A document is typeset once: the same code is read back from a cache on disk,
    in any process.

    Args:
        typst_code: The document: Typst markup.
        font_size: The size of the text: an em is `font_size / 96` scene units (0.5 at
            48).
        typst_preamble: Typst code set before the document: rules, definitions,
            imports.
        font_paths: Directories of font files, searched, with their subdirectories,
            before the fonts manimgx ships.
        should_center: Whether the mobject is centered on the origin.
        height: The height to scale the mobject to, in scene units; None to size it by
            `font_size`.
        width: The width to scale it to, in scene units, after `height`; None to size
            it by `font_size`.
        package_path: The directory Typst packages are imported from (as
            `namespace/name/version` directories), besides mitex, which manimgx's
            engine holds; None for none but mitex.
        font_scale: How much larger than `font_size` the text is set: the layout is
            scaled by `font_size * font_scale`, while
            [font_size][manimgx.Typst.font_size] reads `font_size`. A
            [Text][manimgx.Text] sets it to its font's own scale, which makes a capital
            as tall in every font.
        color: The color of Typst's default ink, black; None for white.
        fill_color: A fill color for every part; None keeps the typeset ones.
        fill_opacity: A fill opacity for every part, from 0 to 1; None keeps the
            typeset ones.
        stroke_color: A stroke color for every part; None keeps the typeset ones.
        stroke_opacity: A stroke opacity for every part, from 0 to 1; None keeps the
            typeset ones.
        stroke_width: A stroke width for every part, in hundredths of a scene unit;
            None keeps the typeset ones, which scale with the mobject.

    `1 + line_spacing` ems apart, whatever the glyphs on them. The parts are the glyphs,
    in reading order, spaces excluded: `Text("Hello")[0]` is the "H", a
    [TypstGlyph][manimgx.mobjects.text.TypstGlyph]. A ligature is one glyph
    (the "ffi" of "office", in the default font) unless `disable_ligatures`.

    A text is set in one font, from the fonts manimgx ships, so it looks the same on
    every machine: New Computer Modern unless `font` names another. "serif",
    "sans-serif" (or "sans") and "monospace" (or "mono") are New Computer Modern, Noto
    Sans and DejaVu Sans Mono. Fonts in `font_paths` come first; a family neither they
    nor manimgx have is read from the system's fonts, and one found nowhere falls back
    to New Computer Modern. A character the font lacks is set in another font that has
    it: manimgx ships Noto faces for Arabic, Hebrew, the Indic scripts, Thai, Chinese,
    Japanese, Korean and more, with symbols and emoji. In any font, a capital is 0.449
    scene units tall at the default size, 48, and in proportion at others: each font is
    scaled to that, and `font_size` still reads the size asked for.

    A text whose first letter is from a right-to-left script (Arabic, Hebrew) is set as
    a right-to-left paragraph, its lines lined up on the right. A Chinese, Japanese or
    Korean text takes its language from its characters (Japanese with kana, Korean with
    hangul, else Chinese), which gives its Han characters their regional forms.

    Keys pick characters: a slice `"[a:b]"` of the text as written, spaces included, or
    a string, each occurrence of it (a key that occurs nowhere picks nothing). `t2s` and
    `t2w` set what they pick in another slant or weight; `gradient`, then `t2g`, then
    `t2c` color it, each over the one before. Color never changes the layout: the text
    is laid out once, and each glyph takes the color of the characters it draws — a
    ligature that a color boundary crosses is cut there, each piece in its characters'
    color. A custom glyph's path-building methods also construct its color pieces.

        text: The text, as written.
        line_spacing: The space between lines, in ems: the baselines are

    There is no LaTeX installation: the LaTeX is converted to Typst (by mitex, part of
    the engine) and typeset in display style, in New Computer Modern Math, white unless
    styled. Most of LaTeX's math converts: fractions, roots, sums and integrals,
    matrices (`pmatrix`, `bmatrix`, `array`), `cases` and `aligned`, accents, `\mathbb`
    and the other alphabets, `\text`, `\left` and `\right`, `\color`, `\newcommand`.
    Packages don't — `\usepackage` and their commands, such as `\ce` or `\SI` — nor does
    `\def`: a command mitex doesn't know raises a
    [TypstError][manimgx.drawing.typesetting.TypstError].

    The strings are one formula, joined by `arg_separator` and typeset whole, so parting
    a formula moves none of its glyphs. Each string is a part, a
    [MathTexPart][manimgx.MathTexPart] of the glyphs it adds, and double braces set a
    part apart within a string: `MathTex("{{a^2}} + {{b^2}} = {{c^2}}")` has the five
    parts of the first example below. A string that stands on its own (its braces,
    environments and `\left`…`\right` closed within it) holds exactly its glyphs. The
    rest, such as a fraction's bar or the glyphs of a fragment like `"^2"`, go to the
    first fragment between the standing strings around them: in
    `MathTex(r"\frac{", "a", "}{", "b", "}")` the bar is the closing `"}"`'s, where TeX
    draws it, and in `MathTex(r"e^{i", r"\pi}")`, split inside a term, every glyph is
    the first part's. A formula whose parts can't be told apart raises ValueError.

    `substrings_to_isolate` and `tex_to_color_map` split the strings further;
    [set_color_by_tex][manimgx.MathTex.set_color_by_tex] and
    [get_part_by_tex][manimgx.MathTex.get_part_by_tex] find parts by their LaTeX, and
    [TransformMatchingTex][manimgx.TransformMatchingTex] moves each part to the part
    written the same way in another formula. Read as text (see [Tex][manimgx.Tex]), the
    strings are typeset one after another instead.

    Args:
        *tex_strings: The formula, in LaTeX: a string per part (a number is written as
            a string), and a part per `{{…}}` within one.
        arg_separator: What joins the strings into `tex_string`, the formula they are
            typeset as.
        substrings_to_isolate: Substrings to make parts of their own: each string is
            split around every occurrence of each.
        tex_to_color_map: A color for each substring, which is made a part of its own
            and colored.
        tex_environment: How the strings are read: with a name containing "align" (the
            default, "align*"), as math; with any other, or None, as LaTeX text, math
            between `$` signs.
