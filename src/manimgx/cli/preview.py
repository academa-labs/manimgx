"""`manimgx preview`: a scene in manimgx's player, in a window of its own, made again each time
its code is saved.

The scene runs here, as `manimgx render` runs it, but its film is recorded as a take (see
[`Film`][manimgx.Film]) and sent to a [`Window`][manimgx.Window], which plays it as it is made.
On a save the scene runs again — at once: a run a save has made out of date is cut — and its new
take replaces the old at the same moment, once it gets there: an edit never loses the place. An
error is shown over the last good take.
