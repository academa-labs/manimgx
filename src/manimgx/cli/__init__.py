"""The manimgx command line: a scene rendered to video, inspected, presented,
and previewed live.

    manimgx render scene.py [Scene] [-o video.mp4]      the video, a storyboard, layout problems
    manimgx inspect scene.py [Scene] [-t 0,2.5,end]    timeline, storyboard, layout problems
    manimgx present scene.py [Scene]                    its sections as slides, in the browser
    manimgx preview scene.py [Scene]                    a window playing it, again on each save

What a command writes goes to stdout, one line per file, then its report; errors go to stderr.
Exit 0 on success, 1 when the scene fails (or `inspect` finds problems), 2 when the command is
wrong. Help is plain text when piped (an agent's shell), rich on a terminal.
