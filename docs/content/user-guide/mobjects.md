# Mobjects

A mobject is anything that you can show in a video. This page shows the kinds of
mobjects, and how to change their color, size and angle.

## Shapes

```python
import manimgx as m


class Shapes(m.Scene):
    def construct(self) -> None:
        circle = m.Circle(radius=1)
        square = m.Square(side_length=2)
        rectangle = m.Rectangle(width=3, height=2)
        triangle = m.Triangle()
        star = m.Star()
        shapes = m.VGroup(circle, square, rectangle, triangle, star)
        shapes.arrange(m.RIGHT, buff=0.6)
        self.add(shapes)
```

Each shape takes its size when you make it: a circle its `radius`, a square its
`side_length`, a rectangle its `width` and `height`. Without them, a shape has a size of
its own: a circle's radius is 1, and a square's side is 2.

To make a shape of your own, give `m.Polygon` its corners:
`m.Polygon([0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0])`.

## Lines, arrows and dots

A line goes from one point to another:

```python
import manimgx as m


class Lines(m.Scene):
    def construct(self) -> None:
        line = m.Line([-5, 1, 0], [-1, 1, 0])
        arrow = m.Arrow([1, 1, 0], [5, 1, 0])
        dashed = m.DashedLine([-5, -1, 0], [-1, -1, 0])
        dot = m.Dot([3, -1, 0])
        self.add(line, arrow, dashed, dot)
```

An arrow stops a little before its points, so that it doesn't cover what it points at.
To make it touch them, give `buff=0`. A dot is a small filled circle at a point.

## Text and formulas

`m.Text` shows text, and `m.MathTex` shows a formula, written in LaTeX:

```python
import manimgx as m


class TextAndFormula(m.Scene):
    def construct(self) -> None:
        text = m.Text("Hello, world")
        formula = m.MathTex(r"e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0")
        lines = m.VGroup(text, formula)
        lines.arrange(m.DOWN, buff=1)
        self.add(lines)
```

Write a formula in a raw string, `r"..."`, so that Python keeps its backslashes.
[Text and math](text-and-math.md) shows more.

## Color

Give a mobject its color when you make it:

```python
import manimgx as m


class Colors(m.Scene):
    def construct(self) -> None:
        outline = m.Circle(color=m.BLUE)
        filled = m.Circle(color=m.BLUE, fill_opacity=0.5)
        thick = m.Circle(color=m.YELLOW, stroke_width=12)
        circles = m.VGroup(outline, filled, thick)
        circles.arrange(m.RIGHT, buff=1)
        self.add(circles)
```

- `color` colors the outline and the inside.
- `fill_opacity` fills the inside: 0 is empty, 1 is solid. Most shapes are empty
  unless you fill them.
- `stroke_width` sets the width of the outline: 4 for most shapes, and 6 for an
  arrow, unless you give another.

manimgx has names for colors: `m.WHITE`, `m.GREY`, `m.BLUE`, `m.TEAL`, `m.GREEN`,
`m.YELLOW`, `m.GOLD`, `m.ORANGE`, `m.RED`, `m.PINK`, `m.PURPLE` and more. Most of them
also come in five shades: `m.BLUE_A` is the lightest blue, and `m.BLUE_E` the
darkest. You can also give a color as a hex code, such as `"#58C4DD"`.

To change a color later, use `set_color`, `set_fill` or `set_stroke`:
`circle.set_fill(m.RED, opacity=1)`.

## Size and angle

`scale` multiplies the size of a mobject, and `rotate` turns it counterclockwise:

```python
import manimgx as m


class SizeAndAngle(m.Scene):
    def construct(self) -> None:
        small = m.Square()
        small.scale(0.5)
        turned = m.Square()
        turned.rotate(45 * m.DEGREES)
        large = m.Square()
        large.scale(1.5)
        squares = m.VGroup(small, turned, large)
        squares.arrange(m.RIGHT, buff=1)
        self.add(squares)
```

`scale(2)` makes a mobject twice as large, and `scale(0.5)` half as large. Its center
stays where it is. `45 * m.DEGREES` is an angle of 45 degrees.

## Groups

A group is a mobject made of other mobjects. When you move, scale, color or animate a
group, you do it to every mobject in it. `group[0]` is the first one, `group[1]` the
second.

```py
shapes = m.VGroup(circle, square, triangle)
shapes.set_color(m.YELLOW)  # all three turn yellow
shapes[0].scale(2)  # the circle grows
```

## What covers what

A mobject that you add later covers a mobject that you added before. To bring a
mobject to the front, give it a higher z-index: `circle.set_z_index(1)`.

The [reference](../reference/mobjects/index.md) shows every kind of mobject.

Your mobjects are in place. [Animations](animations.md) shows how to move and change them.
