## Unreleased

### Changed

- Show measured render times in a static benchmark chart.
- Use a Markdown table for the benchmark comparison images.
- Install ManimGX in the Quickstart with one command, `pip install manimgx`, and run `manimgx` directly throughout the docs.
- Move the benchmark to `benchmarks/`, whose README explains its scenes, method and results; the README's numbers link to it.
- Arrange the Rendering and sharing page by command, with settings, tall videos and rendering from Python under Render.

### Fixed

- Preserve the benchmark comparison images' aspect ratios when PyPI narrows the README table.

## 0.1.1

### Changed

- Updated package author metadata to Academa Team. The font packages have metadata-only post-releases; their font files are unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed GPU validation failures when meshes with materials share a scene with ordinary meshes, overlays, or point sprites, including during fades.

## 0.1.0

First release of ManimGX.
