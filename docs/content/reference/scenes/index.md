# Scenes

```python fold title="The film's code"
import manimgx as m


class ScenesHero(m.Scene):
    def construct(self) -> None:
        circle = m.Circle(color=m.BLUE, fill_opacity=0.5)
        words = m.Text("Hello!", font_size=72)
        self.play(m.Create(circle))
        self.play(m.FadeOut(circle))
        self.play(m.Write(words))
        self.wait()
```

A scene is one video. Make a class from [Scene][manimgx.Scene], and write what happens in its
`construct` method: manimgx runs it from top to bottom, and each line adds to the video in
that order. The class's name is the video's: the scene `Hello` makes `Hello.mp4`.

Time passes only in [play][manimgx.Scene.play] and [wait][manimgx.Scene.wait]. A play starts
when the one before it ends and lasts as long as its longest animation; a wait holds the
picture, while updaters keep running. [add][manimgx.Scene.add] shows a mobject at once,
taking no time.
