"""A griffe extension: what is deprecated is left out of the API reference.

A name manimgx keeps for code written for Manim CE, and no longer teaches (another name of a
class, an empty subclass, a method's second name), is decorated with PEP 702's
`@deprecated(message, category=None)`: ty flags each use of it, and nothing warns as it runs.
The reference documents the name to use instead. So each object so decorated is taken out of
the package as griffe loads it, for mkdocstrings (its `extensions` option names this module)
and for the reference's tests alike: it has no entry and no place among its class's members,
and a link to it stops resolving. A deprecated class stays where it is defined, for the
classes made from it, whose constructor and members are its (TransformMatchingShapes', its
base's): only its other names go, the package's among them, and no page shows it.

The decorator is read from the source, as ty reads it, not as `__deprecated__` at run time:
another name kept the same class as it runs (a decorated class `if TYPE_CHECKING:`, an
assignment `else:`) has no `__deprecated__`, and a class's is inherited by its subclasses. A
property is decorated on its getter, which griffe turns into an attribute without decorators:
its getter's are read from the module's source.
