"""A scene shows the world at each frame's instant, whichever way it computes it, and
whatever its frame rate; it holds its mobjects as its methods say, and runs their updaters
as they stand when their turns come.

- A play the scene computes ahead of time (a pure play: tweens only) shows exactly what the
  same play computed frame by frame shows, for any story, rate functions that overshoot
  included.
- The world at an instant does not depend on the frame rate, for any story: a part begins
  and finishes at its window, an instant the scene computes whether a frame falls there or
  not, and takes the world as it is then, all else brought there first.
- A group of no animations is an error. A wait that stops at a frame ends there: what is
  simulated is brought to that instant.
- Over any run of `add`, `remove`, `add_foreground_mobjects`, `remove_foreground_mobjects`
  and `bring_to_back` over groups that share members, the scene holds what a plain model
  holds: adding takes the added families' members out of the groups that held them (each
  group split, its other members kept in place) and puts them in front, each once, under the
  foreground; removing splits every group that held a removed member the same way; the
  members are each family's in order, each once at its last place, stably sorted by z-index,
  and a frame draws those with points, the foreground's last. However deep the groups are.
- An instant walks a mobject's updaters, then the scene's, as they stood when it began, and
  what is appended to them on the way: each runs when its turn comes if it is still among its
  owner's updaters, once per time it was added, handed the time since it, or an updater equal
  to it, last ran or was added; a recorder runs after everything else, if it is still there.
