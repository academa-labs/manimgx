"""What a run asks of manimgx, counted: work, which is the same on every machine, where time is
not.

`count(fn)` runs `fn` and counts, in manimgx's own code:

- `calls`, the Python functions run, and `loops`, the loops' iterations (a jump back), with
  `sys.monitoring`: the interpreter's work;
- `points`, the points computed from a geometry's pieces (`Blend.points`): the numpy work a
  path or mesh costs to read;
- `hashed`, the bytes hashed (`digest`) to name shapes and uploads;
- `uploaded`, the bytes handed to the engine to keep: shapes, meshes, rows, textures.

Counts are exact and the same on every system; `loops` also depends on the bytecode, so on
the Python version. Counting slows a run down by about half.

    python -m tests.benchmarks.work OUT.json ARGS…

runs the command line `manimgx ARGS…` in this process, counting, and writes its work to OUT.json
(what the timed benchmarks show beside a change).
