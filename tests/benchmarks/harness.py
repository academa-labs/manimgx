"""Two manimgx trees, timed side by side on one machine.

A `Tree` is a manimgx package on disk: its `src/`, its engine built in it. `here()` is this
checkout's; `checkout(ref, trees)` makes one of a commit under `trees` (its sources from git; its
engine this checkout's when the commit's engine sources are this checkout's, else built), or
takes another checkout's. A `Workload` is a scene file, rendered as a user renders it:
`manimgx render`, in a fresh process with a tree first on its path. `run` measures one render,
from launch to exit; `compare` runs a workload with two trees in turns, a round running both in
a random order.

Time is compared, never pinned: the two trees run on the same machine at the same time, so what
the machine does to one it does to the other, and a round's ratio is what is kept.
