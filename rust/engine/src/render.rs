//! ManimGX's player: draws blends of shapes — every kind, 2D and 3D — and encodes them to MP4.
//!
//! Python uploads each shape once (a path's curves as their control points, a point cloud, a
//! mesh), each brush of several rows once (gradient stops, per-point or per-vertex colors) and each
//! image once; then per frame it sends one record per object: shape keys, two 3×4 matrices, a
//! reveal window, colors, widths, flags. Every animation is new numbers.
//!
//! Every view's paths are drawn exactly (see `vector`): their curves flattened on the GPU, every
//! frame, to the size they are drawn at through the view's camera, each pixel covered by the area
//! inside it, and composited per pixel in depth order (a 2D view's: its draw order). Point clouds
//! and meshes are drawn by the raster pipeline (`blend.wgsl`): a 2D view's into layers laid in their
//! place in the order, a 3D view's into its z-buffered base, which the composite lays at its depth
//! (its see-through meshes' fragments too, through per-pixel lists, and its see-through points,
//! through slabs between its layers). Per object the camera is folded into
//! the blend (C = camera · M, once per object on the CPU): a vertex costs one 4×4 per term.
//!
//! The same drawing runs natively (read back, or encoded to MP4: see `export`) and in the
//! browser, onto a canvas with WebGPU (see `web`).
