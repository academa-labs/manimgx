//! It is Python's extension module (`python`), which also reads sound (`audio`): natively with
//! the GPU, a film's video encoded by x264, its sound as AAC (`export`); in Pyodide without it,
//! a scene's frames recorded as a take (`take`: its arrays coded against the ones they
//! replace, `pack`). A take is played by the player (`player`: a projector of takes, `project`,
//! on a clock, with a face, `chrome`, and a sound, `speaker`), the same on two screens: a window
//! on this machine (`window`) and, the engine compiled to WebAssembly, a page's canvas (`web`).
